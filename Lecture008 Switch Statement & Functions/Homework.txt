Ques 1. HOW WILL YOU EXIT IF YOU PUT SWITCH CASE INSIDE INFINITE LOOP AND WHEN YOU CAN'T USE SWITCH STATEMENT?

CODE:
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{

//this while condition will always be true if exit( is not put.)
while(1)
{
  cout<<"HOW YOU DOIN????"<<endl;

  int num=1;
  switch(num)
  {
    case 1: cout<<"I'M FINE"<<endl;
    break;
  }
  exit(0);
}

}

ANSWER: BY PUTTING EXIT(0) , WE CAN EXIT OUT OF INFINITE LOOP.

Ques.2 WHY WE CAN'T USE CONTINUE STATEMENT IN CASE OF SWITCH CASE?

ANSWER : Because you have a continue outside of a loop. continue is for jumping to the next iteration of a loop, 
skipping the remainder of the current iteration. But you don't have any loop in that code. 
What you want for breaking out of a switch case block is the keyword break.
 continue and break have different purposes, and while break is relevant to both switch and to loops, 
 continue is not -- there's no "top" to jump back to.
