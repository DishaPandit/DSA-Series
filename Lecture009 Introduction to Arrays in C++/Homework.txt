2. How to initialize entire array with a non-zero value?

Ans - 
Method 1 - 

int arr[10] = {[0...9] = 4};

Here, 0 is first index, 9 is last index, 
and 4 is the value with which we want to initialize

Method 2 -

for(int i =0; i<size ; i++)
{
    arr[i] =  value;
}

3. int arr[5]  = {2,4};         //will initialize 0th and 1st index with 2 and 4. Rest all will be zero
