Binary search works on monotonic function ie either increasing or decreasing
Algo -
1. Find mid element compare it with key. If found , return index.
2. If key < mid, search in left half
3. else serach in right half
4. repeat till s<=e

Calculate time complexity of binary search.

1st iteration = n elements
2nd iteration = n/2 elements
3rd iteration = n/4 elements
4th iteration = n/8 elements
.
.
.
.
.
nth iteration = n/2^k elements which is equal to 1

=> n/2^k = 1
=> n = 2^k
=> k = log n 

Hence time complexity of binary search is O(log n)
