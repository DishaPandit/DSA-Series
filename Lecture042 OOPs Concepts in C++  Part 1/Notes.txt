--> Access modifiers are of three types in c++ - public, private and protected
--> By default, it is private.
--> private data members can be accessed only inside the same class where it is defined
--> public data members can be accessed inside and outside the class where it is defined
--> To access private data members, we can use getter and setter

--> Why should the copy constructor accept its 
    parameter by reference in C++?

    Because if it's not by reference, it's by value. 
    To do that you make a copy, and to do that you call 
    the copy constructor. But to do that, we need to make a 
    new value, so we call the copy constructor, and so on...

    (You would have infinite recursion because 
    "to make a copy, you need to make a copy".)
