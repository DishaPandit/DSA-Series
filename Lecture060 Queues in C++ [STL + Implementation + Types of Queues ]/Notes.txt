1. Input restricted queue - queue in which push operation is allowed on rear end
but pop operation is allowed on both front and rear end
Hence, functions will be push_back(), pop_front(), pop_back()

2. Output restricted queue - queue in which pop operation is allowed on front end
but push operation is allowed on both front and rear end
Hence, functions will be pop_front(), push_front(), push_back()

3. Doubly ended queue - queue in which we can push and pop from both ends
Hence, functions will be push_back(), push_front(), pop_back(), pop_front()
