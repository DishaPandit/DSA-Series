Full binary tree - A full binary tree can be defined as a binary tree in which all the nodes have 0 or two children

Heap order property - 

Heap is a complete binary tree that comes with a heap order property

Below are the heap order property -

1. Max heap - values in parent nodes are greater than or equal to child node. It is complete binary tree

2. Min heap - values in parent nodes are smaller than or equal to child node. It is complete binary tree
